Typesafe wrappers for OpenGL. Heavely inspired by [Haskell OpenGL
bindings](https://github.com/haskell-opengl/OpenGL/).

## Goal

The goal is to establish a semantic connections between OpenGL
functions using strong types like `Program`, `Shader`, `Buffer`, etc,
that are not just numbers but separate incompatible with each other
types.

For example, let's consider two functions and two types:

```c++
namespace gl {
    enum Shader_Type
    {
        VERTEX_SHADER,
        FRAGMENT_SHADER
    };

    struct Shader
    {
        GLuint unwrap;
    };

    ALWAYS_INLINE Shader createShader(Shader_Type type);
    ALWAYS_INLINE void compileShader(Shader shader)
}
```

1. `gl::Shader_Type` and `gl::Shader` make it impossible to pass
incorrect values to `gl::createShader` and `gl::compileShader`.
2. the signatures of the functions "document" the fact `Shader` comes
from `gl::createShader` and should be put into `gl::compileShader`
later.
